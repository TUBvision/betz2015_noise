See example_run.m to learn how to apply the models.

See make_bm_sbc_large.m for an easy example of generating your own stimuli. 

To properly scale model output, first run on make_bm_white's thick, determine the difference between left and right regions, and then divide the model output by that number. See paper for more details.
